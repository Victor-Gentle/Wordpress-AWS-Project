# Setting up a WordPress Site on AWS
This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a WordPress site on AWS, covering the following procedures:

- VPC Setup
- Public and Private Subnet with NAT Gateway
- AWS MySQL RDS Setup
- EFS Setup for WordPress Files
- Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling
## 1. VPC Setup
### Steps:
- Log in to AWS Console: Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
- Navigate to VPC Dashboard: Go to the VPC dashboard.
- Create VPC: Click on "Create VPC" and provide details like name and CIDR block.
- Configure Subnets: Create at least two subnets: one public and one private.
- Internet Gateway: Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC for public subnet internet access.
- Route Tables: Configure route tables for both subnets. Associate the public subnet with the Internet Gateway.
- Security Groups: Create security groups for instances and RDS, allowing necessary inbound/outbound traffic.
## 2. Public and Private Subnet with NAT Gateway
### Steps:
- Create NAT Gateway: Navigate to NAT Gateways and create a new NAT gateway in the public subnet.
- Route Table Configuration: Update the route table of the private subnet to route outbound traffic to the NAT Gateway.
- Network ACLs: Configure Network ACLs to control traffic flow to and from the subnets.
## 3. AWS MySQL RDS Setup
### Steps:
- Navigate to RDS Dashboard: Go to the RDS dashboard.
- Create Database Instance: Click on "Create database" and select MySQL.
- Configure Settings: Choose instance specifications, storage, and database credentials.
- VPC and Subnet Configuration: Associate the RDS instance with the VPC and private subnet.
- Security Groups: Ensure the appropriate security group settings for RDS access.
- Backup and Maintenance: Configure backup retention period and maintenance preferences.
## 4. EFS Setup for WordPress Files
### Steps:
- Navigate to EFS Dashboard: Go to the Amazon EFS dashboard.
- Create File System: Click on "Create file system" and configure settings like performance mode and throughput mode.
- Configure Access: Set up access control and permissions for EC2 instances.
- Mount EFS: Mount the EFS file system onto EC2 instances that will host WordPress.
- File Permissions: Ensure proper file permissions for WordPress files and directories.
## 5. Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling
### Steps:
- Create Load Balancer: Go to the EC2 dashboard and navigate to Load Balancers. Create an Application Load Balancer.
- Target Groups: Create a target group for WordPress instances.
- Auto Scaling Group: Set up an Auto Scaling group with desired configurations, including launch template, desired capacity, and scaling policies.
- Integration: Integrate the Load Balancer with the Auto Scaling group.
- Health Checks: Configure health checks for the Load Balancer to monitor instance health
## Additional Considerations:
- Cost Management: Monitor AWS usage to optimize costs.
- Security Best Practices: Implement security best practices such as encryption, IAM roles, and VPC flow logs.
- Scaling: Regularly monitor performance metrics and adjust configurations for optimal scalability.
- Backups and Disaster Recovery: Set up regular backups and implement disaster recovery plans.
By following these detailed procedures, you can successfully deploy a WordPress site on AWS, leveraging various services for scalability, reliability, and security.
